<STAGEDIR>Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners</STAGEDIR>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:</LINE>
<LINE>Is this a holiday? what! know you not,</LINE>
<LINE>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a labouring day without the sign</LINE>
<LINE>Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Commoner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, a carpenter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</LINE>
<LINE>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</LINE>
<LINE>You, sir, what trade are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,</LINE>
<LINE>as you would say, a cobbler.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe</LINE>
<LINE>conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,</LINE>
<LINE>if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, cobble you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I</LINE>
<LINE>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's</LINE>
<LINE>matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon</LINE>
<LINE>to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I</LINE>
<LINE>recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</LINE>
<LINE>neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</LINE>
<LINE>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself</LINE>
<LINE>into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,</LINE>
<LINE>to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</LINE>
<LINE>What tributaries follow him to Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?</LINE>
<LINE>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</LINE>
<LINE>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</LINE>
<LINE>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,</LINE>
<LINE>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</LINE>
<LINE>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</LINE>
<LINE>The livelong day, with patient expectation,</LINE>
<LINE>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:</LINE>
<LINE>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</LINE>
<LINE>Have you not made an universal shout,</LINE>
<LINE>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the replication of your sounds</LINE>
<LINE>Made in her concave shores?</LINE>
<LINE>And do you now put on your best attire?</LINE>
<LINE>And do you now cull out a holiday?</LINE>
<LINE>And do you now strew flowers in his way</LINE>
<LINE>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!</LINE>
<LINE>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</LINE>
<LINE>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</LINE>
<LINE>That needs must light on this ingratitude.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,</LINE>
<LINE>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</LINE>
<LINE>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</LINE>
<LINE>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</LINE>
<LINE>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all the Commoners</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>See whether their basest metal be not moved;</LINE>
<LINE>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</LINE>
<LINE>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</LINE>
<LINE>This way will I disrobe the images,</LINE>
<LINE>If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May we do so?</LINE>
<LINE>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is no matter; let no images</LINE>
<LINE>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,</LINE>
<LINE>And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</LINE>
<LINE>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</LINE>
<LINE>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing</LINE>
<LINE>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</LINE>
<LINE>Who else would soar above the view of men</LINE>
<LINE>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
